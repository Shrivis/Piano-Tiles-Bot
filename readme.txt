Install all requirements with:
~# pip install -r requirements.txt

Setting global variables:
there are five variables that you need to change
x1, x2, x3, x4, y and start_y
open the game online or in any app, 
make sure the game always opens with exactly the same coordinates, and don't move the window

Method 1:
take a screenshot of the entire window, 
then use paint to find out the coordinates for all global variables by looking at the setGlobal.jpg

Method 2:
run the mousePosition.py file in the terminal and every time you press y and enter. 
it'll tell you the exact coordinates of your mouse pointer. 
Just point at locations given in setGlobal.jpg and find out the coordinates for global variables

Using the Failsafe: 
the program run in an infinite loop and clicks on anything black or blue within gameBox, just move the mouse outside the gameBox and the program will terminate
