**Setting global variables:**</br>
there are five variables that you need to change</br>
x1, x2, x3, x4, y and start_y</br>
open the game online or in any app, make sure the game always opens with exactly the same coordinates, and don't move the window

**Method 1:**</br>
take a screenshot of the entire window,</br>
then use paint to find out the coordinates for all global variables by looking at the *setGlobal.jpg*

**Method 2:**</br>
run the mousePosition.py file in the terminal and every time you press y and enter. </br>
it'll tell you the exact coordinates of your mouse pointer. Just point at locations given in *setGlobal.jpg* and find out the coordinates for global variables

**Using the Failsafe:**</br> 
the program run in an infinite loop and clicks on anything black or blue within gameBox, </br>just move the mouse outside the gameBox and the program will terminate

**I tested this game bot on:**</br>
